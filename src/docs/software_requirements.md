## Introduction
### Purpose of this Document
https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/how-and-why-to-write-a-great-game-design-document--cms-23545
This Document is the Software Requirements(SRS)/Game Design Document (GDD). It is based on the stakeholder Requiremts and should give an overview over the develpment goals and ideas. It should give a **gerneral idea on all aspects of the game** and connect them, so the effort of all develpment members goes in the same direction and we can share easily with new people that want to get on board in the project. 
### Conventions
This Document is managed by the requirements manager. It should not go into too much detail to exclude double work. If needed details can be managed in a _single point of truth_ (GIT?). It includes written information, images, graphs, charts and lists (as needed). If possible we want to start developing high level requirements, that we can specify in other documents. "_AD > Comment..._" indicates, that we have to talk in the team about this topic and add the information later.
### Summary of the Game
_AD > Here we should note what the Game would look like in a short Summary. It's called elevator pitch. The most important message of the game in about 10min. Question we shoud answer: What is the essence of the game?_
Game concept:  
Genre:  
Target audience:  
### Project Scope
_AD > Here we want to define how far we want to take it and what work should suffice. Also what we explicitly don't want to do._ 
### Project Team
_AD > Tem members with roles, we should definetly think of all roles necessary to finish the project. Some roles can be taken by more than one person and soome can be left untaken until we find the correct person for it._
